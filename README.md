# surface-generalized-Born

## To do

1. Documentation

   - foo
   
2. MATLAB codes

3. Geometries


## Introduction

This is a curated set of MATLAB codes and data files from papers
related to FFTSVD, BIBEE, and SLIC. Key references are given below.
The MATLAB codes are included as Git submodules, and the geometries
are included here explicitly

## Installation and Quick start

You can obtain both the codes and the geometries by running
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jbardhan/surface-generalized-Born.git 
```

Then open Octave, change directory into the `surface-generalized-Born` repository, and then
```
runSampleSurfaceIntegration
```

I have not tested this code in Matlab recently and don't know when I'll have the opportunity.


## Details

### MATLAB codes

#### The `pointbem` Repository

This provides a very, very simple implementation of the
boundary-element method that represents the molecular surface with 

#### The `panelbem` Repository

This repository has most of the significant functions for performing
the surface integrations and reference BEM calculations.  It
implements a BEM that uses planar triangles to discretize the
molecular surface, piecewise constant basis functions on each
triangle, and centroid collocation.


### Geometries

#### Born-ion

#### Spherical-protein

#### Arg

This comes from our earlier `testasymmetry` repo whose origin goes
back to Bardhan and Knepley (2014).


#### BPTI (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor)

This atomistic model of a protein comes from Molavi Tabrizi, Bardhan,
Cooper et al. (2017).
